Advent of Code in Rust.

Personal learning project -- I plan to improve previous solutions, project structure, testing, as I read the book and so on.

#### Initialize a new year:
- `. ./scripts/init_year.sh ./src/solutions <year>`
- bind the functions to command line arguments in `main.rs`

#### Run:
- `cargo run <day>` (currently only AoC2023 is implemented)
